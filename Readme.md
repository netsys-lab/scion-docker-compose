# SCION Docker-Compose Scripts
This repo contains tooling to use an adapted version of SCION's topogen to generate working docker-compose topologies. It contains one Dockerfile for a `topogen` container that you can run to generate the topology (so no need to fork my scion branch) and containers for the SCION `control` `router` and `daemon`.

## Get Started
At first, you need to build all containers, so run `./build-containers.sh`. This may take a few minutes.

To generate a topology, use the `netsys-lab/topogen` container the following way:

- `mkdir gen`
- `docker run -v $(pwd)/sample.topo:/share/topology.json -v $(pwd)/gen:/share/output netsys-lab/topogen`

**Note:** Just change sample.topo with any topology you want to use. But do not change the second docker volume, this needs to be always `gen`.

Inside `gen` you now have the complete SCION topology including a `docker-compose.yml` file. You can run the topology with:
- `cd gen`
- `docker-compose up -d`

To ensure all containers are running use `docker ps` the output should look similar to this:
```

```

You can now test connectivity. The `daemon` containers have the `scion` binary inside it. So you can run `showpaths` inside them. To execute something inside a container, choose the CONTAINER ID of a daemon container (in my case `5cd509f283d7` for the daemon in `ff00_0_111_1`) and run `docker exec -it 5cd509f283d7 /bin/bash`.

Now you can do something like `scion showpaths 1-ff00:0:112` and it should output paths. The correct `SCION_DAEMON` env should be set for each daemon container.

To shut down the topology, run `docker-compose down`. **Note:** It's essential to stop the containers and remove the networks, otherwise you may encounter strange errors...

## Troubleshooting
- I only tested this with small topologies so far (e.g. tiny.topo), so there may be issues with large topologies.
- The `daemon` and `control` containers run the SCION dispatcher in the background, which may crash without notice. You can then inspect the log of the container and restart it.
- If you encounter errors that indicate that networks are already in use, ensure that you did `docker-compose down` or remove networks manually.
